         <p>Hello, my name is Lucie of Green Leaf Illustrations. I have been a watercolor artist for over a decade and
            teacher for about half that time. I have taught a wide variety of age and skills groups across the years.
            Through this four week program I would like to get you outside and painting the lovely plants right in your
            backyard. Tag your artwork on social media with the hashtag #greenLeafLearn so I can see all your beautiful
            work!</p>
